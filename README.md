# Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Predictive Modeling & Insights
This project focuses on identifying customers who are likely to churn using robust machine learning techniques, feature engineering, and business-centric analysis. Designed to help stakeholders make proactive, data-driven retention strategies, this end-to-end pipeline demonstrates how analytics can directly influence customer loyalty and revenue.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights
âœ… Built a full-fledged churn prediction pipeline using real-world customer data
âœ… Engineered and selected features that significantly improved model performance
âœ… Deployed classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
âœ… Achieved meaningful model evaluation with confusion matrices and classification metrics
âœ… Delivered actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value

## Problem Statement
Customer churn poses a critical challenge for businesses. The cost of acquiring a new customer is significantly higher than retaining an existing one. The goal of this analysis is to:

Identify patterns in historical customer behavior

Predict customers at risk of churning

Recommend retention strategies based on data insights

## Key Sections of the Notebook
#### 1. Package Imports & Setup
Standard libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Uncovered hidden trends such as:

Relationship between service usage and churn

Demographic indicators of churn

Role of customer tenure and contract type

#### 3. Feature Engineering
Created binary flags from categorical data

Handled missing values and outliers

Performed label encoding and scaling for model readiness

#### 4. Model Training & Evaluation
Tested multiple ML models and compared performance using:

Accuracy

Precision & Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

#### 5. Results Interpretation & Business Insights
Mapped statistical findings to strategic decisions, e.g.:

Customers with month-to-month contracts and high service usage are more likely to churn

Long-tenure customers with annual contracts are more loyal
